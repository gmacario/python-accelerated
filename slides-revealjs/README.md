# slides-revealjs

File `slides.md` in this directory contains the slides in Markdown.

## How to display slides

### Using reveal.js

The slides may be rendered using the [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) HTML presentation framework.

### Using VScode

Alternatively, if you are using Visual Studio Code you may install
the "[reveal-markdown](https://github.com/tokiedokie/reveal-markdown)" 
extension

> VSCode: View > Extensions 

then install extension "reveal-markdown" 
(do not install "vscode-reveal" which is no longer maintained)

Once the extension is installed, press `Ctrl-Shift-P` to activate the Command Palette,
then run the following command 

> "VSCode Reveal: Focus on Slides View"

which will make it easier to navigate across the slides of the presentation.

At the top right of this view you should also find a few icons which allow you to

- Export the slides in HTML 
- Export the slides in PDF
- Open presentation in browser
- Show presentation by side
